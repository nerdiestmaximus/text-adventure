## Main Street
The main street of the town is completely empty. The only sign of movement is various papers floating in the wind. The buildings are all shades of tan and grey, and with very little windows giving them the appearance of cliffs. The signs on the shops are all faded and the storefronts are blocked off by metal barriers. Some buildings are in far worse states of disrepair, collapsed ceilings, the works. 
To the southwest is the bank, a large rectangular structure with ornate molded details that are completely alien to the other buildings in town.
To the east is a drug store, a skinny structure in between two massive apartment buildings, it’s sign has long since faded, but the faded orange on the sign is possibly the brightest color in the bleak landscape.
To the north is the exit to the town and a hotel, probably one of the shorter structures in the area ironically. 
## Bank
The bank’s floors are immaculately clean, to the point where you can see your reflection in the flooring. Through the teller windows to the north, you can see the vault door hanging wide open. 
The vault itself is completely empty as well, and the safe-deposit boxes are all open and empty, except for one, locked shut. Lockbox 173. 
	Opening the lockbox reveals a dust-covered note. 
	“Hey there Detective. It’s NAV again. You might be wondering why the town is abandoned. There’s a dangerous criminal known as MZU who’s captured the citizens of this town and is using the city as a ground zeroes to test a chemical weapon capable of wiping out most of the life on the planet, Luckily, he wasn’t able to mass-produce the weapon before he captured the citizens, so I managed to secure the sample he was able to procure and stashed it into the hotel. Go up to room 501 and check inside the toilet lid for a small vial. You need to bring it to the pharmacy where you can dilute the sample using some of the antibiotics I stashed there, thus destroying the weapon entirely. Once you do that, I will contact you and we can go save the denizens of Blackburn, I would have called authorities but I was afraid he would unleash his virus sooner which is why I called you.”

keycard; with the numbers 501 etched into the card surface with fancy gold print reading “ Hotel Burns”.
## Hotel
The lobby of the hotel was very boxy like the rest of the town. The ceiling was made up of a strange tile pattern that seemed to change directions and rotations randomly like it had been tiled by some sort of monkey with a pension for making your eyes water. There is an elevator to the northwest and the automatic doors leading back to Mainstreet to the south. The stairway seems to have collapsed, at least on the ground floor.
# Elevator
	Stepping into the elevator, most of the buttons seem to be missing, specifically button 5, but button four still remains.

# Floor 4
	When the elevator came to a stop and you stepped off you were greeted by a pitch-black hallway. The lights seem to be off so it’s nearly impossible to navigate.

# Floor 4 after using a flashlight
	Illuminating the beige walls you see a passage to the left and to the right out of the hallway. None of the room doors are unlocked, but one in particular, room 404, is welded shut, by a blow torch of some kind, the hinges are crudely welded and the doorknob is a melted mess.

# Floor 4 Going Left
	Leads to a dead end 

# Floor 4 Going Right
	You round the corner and approach a stairwell. The stairs downward seem to be beyond disrepair but the stairs up seem to be in perfect condition. Going up the stairs leads you to floor 5


# Floor 5
	This hallway seems to be lit up, and you quickly find Room 501. At the end of the hallway, you can see a left and right exit, 

# Floor 5 Left
	The elevator doors are wide open and you can see the elevator on floor four and the cables supporting the cart

# Floor 5 Right
	Just a window and a dried-up potted plant.
# Room 501
